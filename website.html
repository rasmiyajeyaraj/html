            <p>Facebook is a popular free social networking website that allows registered users to create profiles, upload photos and video,
            send messages and keep in touch with friends, family and colleagues. The site, which is available in 37 different languages, 
            includes public features such as:
                  <ul type="circle">
                        <li>Marketplace - allows members to post, read and respond to classified ads.</li>
                        <li>Groups - allows members who have common interests to find each other and interact.</li>
                        <li>Events  - allows members to publicize an event, invite guests and track who plans to attend.</li>
                        <li> Pages - allows members to create and promote a public page built around a specific topic.</li>
                        <li> Presence technology - allows members to see which contacts are online and chat.</li>
                  </ul>
            Within each member's personal profile, there are several key networking components.
            The most popular is arguably the Wall, which is essentially a virtual bulletin board.
            Messages left on a member's Wall can be text, video or photos. Another popular component is the virtual Photo Album. 
            Photos can be uploaded from the desktop or directly from a smartphone camera. There is no limitation on quantity, 
            but Facebook staff will remove inappropriate or copyrighted images.  An interactive album feature allows the member's contacts 
            (who are called generically called "friends") to comment on each other's photos and identify (tag) people in the photos. 
            Another popular profile component is status updates, a microblogging feature that allows members to broadcast short Twitter-like announcements
            to their friends. All interactions are published in a news feed, which is distributed in real-time to the member's friends. 
            Facebook offers a range of privacy options to its members.  A member can make all his communications visible to everyone,
            he can block specific connections or he can keep all his communications private. Members can choose whether or not to be searchable, 
            decide which parts of their profile are public, decide what not to put in their news feed and determine exactly who can see their posts. 
            For those members who wish to use Facebook to communicate privately, there is a message feature, which closely resembles email.
            In May 2007, Facebook opened up its developers' platform to allow third-party developers to build applications and widgets that,
            once approved, could be distributed through the Facebook community. In May 2008, Facebook engineers announced Facebook Connect, 
            a cross-site initiative that allows users to publish interactions on third-party partner sites in their Facebook news feed.  </p>

            <p> Instagram was founded in 2010 by Stanford graduates Kevin Systorm and Mike Krieger.
            Initially, Systorm and Kreiger created an HTML5 check-in project called Burbn which was then re-developed 
            to cater only photo-sharing uploads. On October 6, 2010, Instagram was added to the Apple App Store, generating 10,000 
            registered users within the first few hours of it’s app life. In April 2012, Instagram was added to Android phones and was 
            downloaded more than one million times in less than one day. 
            In late 2012, Instagram was purchased by Facebook for $1 billion.
            Instagram currently has about 150 million monthly active users, 75 million daily users and about 25% of global internet users use Twitter.
            Users are divided equally with 50% iPhone users and 50% Android. 90% of users are under the age of 35. 
            Education demographics: Users with some college education are the most active on Instagram with 23% and
            college graduates have the second highest activity at 18%.
            Users with a high school diploma or less make up another 15%. 
            24% of all users use the app several (3+) times a day.
            There are five tabs on Instagram: Home, Explore, Upload, News and Profile.  
            The Explore tab has a scrolling list of photos curated by Instagram for you (based on accounts/photos you have already 
            liked and followed) as well as a search bar to find specific usernames and hashtags. 
            Profiles are provided for users similar to other social media sites.
            These contain biographical information, recently shared photographs and a user photo</p>

           <h5> What is Twitter and why should you use it?</h5>
            <p> Twitter is a 'microblogging' system that allows you to send and receive short posts called tweets. 
            Tweets can be up to 140 characters long and can include links to relevant websites and resources.
            Twitter users follow other users. 
            If you follow someone you can see their tweets in your twitter 'timeline'. 
            You can choose to follow people and organisations with similar academic and personal interests to you.
            You can create your own tweets or you can retweet information that has been tweeted by others. 
            Retweeting means that information can be shared quickly and efficiently with a large number of people.
            Retweet</p>
           <h5>Why use Twitter?</h5>
            <p>Twitter has become increasingly popular with academics as well as students, 
            policymakers, politicians and the general public.
            Many users struggled to understand what Twitter is and how they could use it, 
            but it has now become the social media platform of choice for many.
            The snappy nature of tweets means that Twitter is widely used by smartphone users who don’t want
            to read long content items on-screen.
            Twitter allows you to: </p>
